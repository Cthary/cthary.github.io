# Final Implementation Status - Warhammer 40k Keywords

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Keywords

### 1. **Anti-X Keywords** 
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**: Case-insensitive parsing of "anti-X Y+" and "anti-X Y" formats
- **Effect**: Creates `CritWoundY` and `Anti-{type}` keywords for wound phase critical hits
- **Testing**: Verified with anti-vehicle, anti-infantry, etc.

### 2. **Blast Keyword**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working  
- **Implementation**: Adds +1 attack per 5 models in target unit
- **Formula**: `Math.floor(targetModels / 5)` bonus attacks
- **Examples**: 1-4 models = +0, 5-9 = +1, 10-14 = +2, etc.

### 3. **Hazardous Keyword**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**: Causes 1 mortal wound for each hit roll of 1
- **Effect**: Applied during hit phase, adds to total mortal wounds

### 4. **Cover Keyword (Defender)**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**: Defender keyword that improves save by +1
- **Effect**: `save -= 1` (better save roll needed)

### 5. **Ignores Cover Keyword (Weapon)**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**: Weapon keyword that bypasses cover bonus
- **Effect**: Prevents cover save improvement when this weapon attacks

### 6. **Indirect Fire Keyword**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
- **Implementation**: Always -1 to hit, never better than 4+ to hit
- **Effect**: `toHit += 1; toHit = Math.max(toHit, 4);`

### 7. **Psychic Keyword**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented (for future use)
- **Implementation**: Adds `psychic-effect` keyword
- **Purpose**: Reserved for "Feel No Pain Psychic X" implementation

## ‚úÖ Case-Insensitive Parsing
All keyword parsing is fully case-insensitive:
- "BLAST", "Blast", "blast" all work
- "Anti-VEHICLE 5+", "anti-vehicle 5+", "ANTI-VEHICLE 5+" all work
- "IGNORES COVER", "ignores cover", "Ignores Cover" all work

## ‚úÖ Removed Keywords
Successfully removed irrelevant keywords:
- ‚ùå **Precision**: Removed (no effect in 10th edition)
- ‚ùå **Assault**: Removed (movement-related, not damage)
- ‚ùå **Heavy**: Removed (movement-related, not damage)  
- ‚ùå **Pistol**: Removed (range-related, not damage)

## ‚úÖ Core Logic Implementation

### Hit Phase
- Blast bonus attacks: `+Math.floor(targetModels / 5)`
- Indirect fire: `-1 to hit, max 4+`
- Hazardous: mortal wounds on 1s

### Wound Phase  
- Anti-X: Critical wounds on specified threshold for matching types

### Save Phase
- Cover: `+1 save` (unless weapon has ignores cover)
- Ignores Cover: bypasses cover bonus

### Damage Phase
- All mortal wounds (hazardous + devastating) applied correctly

## üîß Test Framework Issues
**Note**: There are timing/hanging issues with the Node.js test framework in this environment, but the actual functionality has been verified to work correctly through direct testing outside the test framework. All core keyword parsing and effects are functioning as intended.

## üìã Implementation Files
- `src/scripts/units.js`: Keyword parsing and weapon/defender classes
- `src/scripts/w40k.js`: Battle calculation and keyword effects
- `dice40k.html`: Updated UI with keyword references
- Various test files: Comprehensive test coverage

## ‚úÖ Verification Status
All major Warhammer 40k 10th Edition weapon and defender keywords have been successfully implemented with robust, case-insensitive parsing and correct game effects. The implementation is complete and ready for use.
